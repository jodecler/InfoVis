        <p>We came up with a theme that is very present today. The refugee crisis. It is a major problem, especially in Europe. A lot of people die while fleeing their country. These deaths can be due to dangerous crossovers over sea, exhaustion, diseases, starvation, etc. Pro-refugee camps and contra-refugee camps are rising and the politic parties are fighting out the battle whether to accept these people or not. One of the arguments contra-refugee camps have is that there are much more refugees than back in time when we had to flee our country for World War 2 and that we have to refuse them. Besides this argument there are a lot of other, some racist, arguments they use to try to avoid these poor people of coming to Belgium.
        </p>
        <p>
        Due to these discussions, we decided to make a visual representation about the refugees that flee their country to Belgium. The data that we use is from the United Nations Refugee Agency database (http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/overview). This is the most trusting source, in our opinion, to give a good representation of this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
        We have made two different representation pages. On the first main page of our website contains an overview graph which contains the overal number of refugees that fled to Belgium for every year independently from 1951 to now. There is the possibility to select a certain year. When doing this, a list will be visualized containing the top 10 refugee countries of that year accompanied with the major happenings of that year. Besides this, there is also the possibility to compare the number of refugees of two years. 
        </p>
        <p>    
        On the second page you can generate a comparison graph. You have the possibility to choose out of six different comparison graphs. The country you choose will always be compared to Belgium. The countries available to choose from are the neighboring countries of Belgium.
